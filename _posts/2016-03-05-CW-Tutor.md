I have open-sourced a fairly comprehensive morse code tutor I have written (and used) in the Ruby language. It goes by the name of **CW**.

In case you were wondering, **CW** stands for _Continuous Wave_. When communicating by morse code you are effectively interrupting a _continuous wave_ signal with a key to generate dots and dashes. For this reason, the name _CW_ became synonymous with morse code.

## DSL

The tutor is a form of DSL and and a simple test is shown below:

```ruby
cw do
  comment 'read daily quotation via RSS feed (1 article)'
  read_rss(:quotation, 1)
  wpm 55
  ewpm 12
end
```

## Documention

I have documented **CW** using the excellent **Jekyll** _static website generator_, and a very useful _Jekyll plugin_ called **Documentation theme jekyll**.
