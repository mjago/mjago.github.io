# LoRa

The [LoRa Protocol](https://www.semtech.com/lora/) is a type of
low-power, long-range wireless communication technology that is used
for the Internet of Things (IoT) and other machine-to-machine (M2M)
applications. The term "LoRa" is short for "long range," and it was
developed by a company called
[Semtech](https://www.semtech.com/lora/).

LoRa technology operates in the unlicensed radio frequency band and
uses a technique called spread spectrum modulation to enable
long-range communication with low power consumption. The LoRa protocol
uses chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation, which is a type of direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation that spreads the signal
over a wider frequency range than conventional frequency-shift keying
(FSK) modulation. This enables LoRa devices to achieve a range of
several kilometers with low power consumption.

LoRa technology uses a star network topology, with LoRa gateways
serving as a bridge between the end devices and the back-end
network. The end devices, which can be sensors or other IoT devices,
use the LoRa protocol to communicate with the gateways, which then
forward the data to the network server using a backhaul connection
such as Ethernet, cellular, or Wi-Fi.

One of the key benefits of the LoRa protocol is its ability to operate
in challenging environments, such as urban areas with high levels of
interference. LoRa also supports bi-directional communication, which
enables devices to both send and receive data.

Overall, the LoRa protocol is a promising technology for IoT and M2M
applications, due to its long-range capabilities, low power
consumption, and ability to operate in challenging environments.

# LoRaWAN

[LoraWAN](https://www.semtech.com/lora/lorawan-standard) is a protocol
that is built on top of the LoRa physical layer technology. It is a
related but separate technology.

While LoRa is the physical layer technology that enables long-range,
low-power communication, LoRaWAN is the protocol that governs the
communication between LoRa devices and the back-end network. LoRaWAN
provides features such as security, data rates, and network
management, which are necessary for deploying LoRa-based IoT solutions
at scale.

LoRaWAN uses a star-of-stars network architecture, which enables
devices to communicate directly with a gateway, and the gateways to
communicate with a central network server. This architecture enables
LoRaWAN to support large-scale deployments, with millions of devices
connected to a single network.

LoRaWAN supports both uplink and downlink communication, enabling
devices to both send data to the network and receive commands or
messages from the network. It also provides features such as adaptive
data rate (ADR), which adjusts the data rate based on signal strength
and interference levels, and over-the-air activation (OTAA), which
simplifies the process of joining a LoRaWAN network.

Overall, while LoRa and LoRaWAN are related technologies, they serve
different purposes. LoRa provides the physical layer technology for
long-range, low-power communication, while LoRaWAN provides the
network protocol and infrastructure for building scalable IoT
solutions.
