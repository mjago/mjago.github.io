CPT stands for Cone Penetration Test, which is a commonly used in-situ testing method for determining the properties of soil and rock. Seabed CPT scanning involves the use of a specially designed probe that is pushed into the seabed to measure various properties of the soil or sediment. The probe is typically equipped with sensors that measure the resistance, friction, and pore pressure of the seabed material.

Seabed CPT scanning is commonly used in offshore geotechnical investigations for a variety of purposes, such as site characterization, foundation design, and pipeline routing. The data obtained from seabed CPT scanning can provide valuable information about the physical and mechanical properties of the seabed material, which can be used to assess the stability and bearing capacity of the seabed.

Overall, seabed CPT scanning is a useful tool for geotechnical engineers and scientists who need to assess the properties of the seabed for various offshore engineering applications.

Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is a mechanical technique rather than an electromagnetic technique. The test involves pushing a cone-shaped probe into the soil or sediment, typically using a hydraulic ram, and measuring the resistance, friction, and pore pressure of the soil or sediment as the probe is advanced.

There are other geophysical techniques, such as electromagnetic methods, that can also be used to investigate the properties of the subsurface, but these are generally separate from the CPT. For example, some electromagnetic methods, such as marine electromagnetic (EM) surveys, use variations in the electrical conductivity of subsurface materials to generate images of the subsurface.
