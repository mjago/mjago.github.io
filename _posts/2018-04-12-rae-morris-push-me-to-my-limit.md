I first heard **Rae Morris** on the radio station [Chill Radio](http://www.helpmechill.com/) and had to investigate the artist who produced this exquisite record.

*Rae Morris* is from Blackpool, Lancashire, UK - not a typical seed of musical talent.
The single [Push Me To My Limit](https://atlanti.cr/pushmetomylimit) is taken from her new album [SOMEONE OUT THERE](http://atlanti.cr/someoneoutthere) which was released *February 2nd 2018* on **Atlantic Records**.

Here she is singing **Push Me To My Limit** live at **Toerag**.

It is very refreshing to hear that young talent of this calibre from the North of England can get noticed, and I hope Rae releases many more records and has a great career!

Here is the official video for the album [SOMEONE OUT THERE](http://atlanti.cr/someoneoutthere).
