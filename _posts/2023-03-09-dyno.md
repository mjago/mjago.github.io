A dynamometer (often abbreviated as "dyno") is a device that is used to measure power, torque, and other characteristics of an engine, motor, or other rotating machinery. A dyno is essentially a type of machine that applies a controlled load to the device being tested, in order to measure its performance.

There are several different types of dynos, including engine dynos, chassis dynos, and hydraulic dynos. Engine dynos are designed to test engines on a stand-alone basis, while chassis dynos measure the power and torque output of an engine while it is installed in a vehicle. Hydraulic dynos are typically used to test hydraulic systems, such as pumps and motors.

Dyno testing is commonly used in the automotive and motorsports industries to evaluate the performance of engines and other components. By measuring an engine's power output and torque at various points in its operating range, engineers can optimize the engine's design and performance for specific applications.
